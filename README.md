## Experience

#### English as a Second Language Teacher, Spain (Sep 2013 - Jun 2019)

I taught in a variety of contexts ranging from young children in after
school academies to adults in company classes. This diverse nature and
varying personal goals of students required the tailoring of materials
and techniques to suit the indivdual needs of students so as to get the
best possible results.

Teaching has also provided experience of managing people and guiding a
team towards an objective, even if sometimes unwillingly.

#### Apple Online Sales Support, Barcelona, Spain (Aug 2012 - Jan 2013)

Providing sales support meant listening to customers requirements and
desires, analising their needs and producing apropriate advice for their
specific needs.

## Hobbies

#### Cycling

I am a keen road cyclist who enjoys the challenge of a good mountain.

#### Cooking

I enjoy cooking and experimenting with baking and fermentation. Even
if the results aren't always exactly as expected, you will know
better for next time.
