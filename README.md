# Alastair Gilles

I am a software developer who finally decided to take the leap of turning a
hobby into a career. Over the ten years since I first learned to code, I have
dabbled in many programming languages with differing, interesting paradigms.
This history of often starting afresh and applying previous knowledge to a new
environment means I am a fast learning, adaptable developer who isn't daunted
by anything new.

Living abroad for seven years, going from knowing nothing to learning a new culture
and language, has done nothing but strengthen my flexibility and acceptance of the
unknown. Having to teach others to speak your language and having to express
yourself in another language has given me the ability to express myself clearly
and confidently.

As a developer I'm ready to bring an enthusiasm for different ideas and 
productive teamwork to a new industry.

## Skills 

- **Methodical** I follow clear, reasoned processes to ensure that work I do
is efficient, directed and justified.
- **Clear Communication** Teaching students in a language that is not their own
means I well versed in expressing myself in a manner that is easily understood
and considerate other party's perspectives.
- **Learning mindset** Discovering what is unknown to me and broadening my
perspective has been a major drive for me with coding. I have enjoyed learning
new languages as new way to look at and express a problem.
- **Mathematically minded** Having studied physics I have an eye for maths and
tend to analyse and look patterns in anything I undertake. This also drives me
to look for efficiency and elegance in a solution to improve performance and
clarity.
- **Technical Skills**

## Education

#### Makers (Oct 2019 - Feb 2020)

Coding Bootcamp

While I learnt Ruby and JavaScript on the course, the true value of Makers
for me was the processes that I learnt, such as test driven development and
agile workflow in teams, which will be invaluable going forward to write 
realiable, maintainable code in any language or framework.

- Test Driven Development
- Agile workflow
- Pair programming
- Self-led group projects
- Object Oriented Design
- Continuous Integration and automated deployment
- Ruby, JavaScript and accompanying techs and frameworks

#### International House

CELTA (Certificate of English Language Teaching to Adults)

A teaching qualification that gave me many skills to work with people smoothly
and efficiently in teams.

- Maintaining group engagement and focus while offering individual attention.
- Presenting information in a planned, structured, and engaging way.
- Considerate error assessment and correction with specific and useful feedback.
- Conveying information in clear, concise way to avoid confusion or misundestanding.

#### The University of Manchester (Sep 2009 - Jun 2012)

Physics with Theoretical Physics: BSc

A degree that taught me to analyse and breakdown any problem to basic principles. This
is also where I first discovered coding and worked on multiple projects:

- An interactive random maze generator in *C++*
- A simulation of a quantum electron in *Python*
- Processing and analysing data from radio telescopes at Jodrell Bank in *C++*

#### Woodbridge School (2002 - 2009)

A-Levels: Maths (A), Further Maths (A), Physics (A) and Chemistry (B)

GCSEs: 3 A\*s, 5 As and 2 Bs

## Experience

#### English as a Second Language Teacher, Spain (Sep 2013 - Jun 2019)

I taught in a variety of contexts ranging from young children in after
school academies to adults in company classes. This diverse nature and
varying personal goals of students required the tailoring of materials
and techniques to suit the indivdual needs of students so as to get the
best possible results.

Teaching has also provided experience of managing people and guiding a
team towards an objective, even if sometimes unwillingly.

#### Apple Online Sales Support, Barcelona, Spain (Aug 2012 - Jan 2013)

Providing sales support meant listening to customers requirements and
desires, analising their needs and producing apropriate advice for their
specific needs.

## Hobbies

#### Cycling

I am a keen road cyclist who enjoys the challenge of a good mountain.

#### Cooking

I enjoy cooking and experimenting with baking and fermentation. Even
if the results aren't always exactly as expected, you will know
better for next time.
